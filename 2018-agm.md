## President's Report

### Cameron Aavik

```
UQCS has had a very successful year. We have made improvements in almost all aspects of the club and it is something we are very proud of.

On the topic of sponsors, this year we had 12 sponsors compared to 5 sponsors last year. This has been due to significant effort put in from the entire committee and especially Rob with the development of a sponsorship portal to allow for an easy way for sponsors to learn about what the club offers. We have been talking with a few of the sponsors from this year already who were quite happy with what the club offered and are keen to see what we can do next year. We also have received some feedback from sponsors about things we could do better, these include ensuring that their logo appears at all our events, improving our communication channels about job offerings, and having better timing for industry events to ensure higher attendance.

On the topic of events, we have done well this year by hosting a total of 42 events. Last year we held 29 events. This is quite a step up and we hope that the incoming committee can continue with this.

Something I value personally is the focus on making our main events more accessible. Last year most of our events were targeted towards later year students and so we lost a lot of engagement from the first- and second-year students. This was addressed by making each of our primary events accessible to everyone, while leaving the more complex talks to the Fridays.

Our Hackathon was a very successful event this year, with 16 teams that ended up presenting and a total of $2200 in prize money available. We believe that the change towards monetary prizes as opposed to physical prizes was a good decision as it made it possible to split up amongst the winners.

On the other hand, we did run into some issues. Firstly, we were not able to provide shirts this year. It was something we should have gotten on top of and wish that we were able to deliver on it. The reasons for this were primarily because we were having a lot of discussion internally about a rebranding and were going to wait for that to be resolved first. However, we did not go through with the rebranding and by that point it was too late in the semester.

Another issue was with the time at which we advertised our events. Several of our events were advertised in the same week or a few days beforehand. This short notice made it difficult for some people to plan their weeks and led to potentially lower attendance than expected. We addressed this a few weeks ago by expanding the size of the committee and having more people around to coordinate the events and advertise them. It is my recommendation for the incoming committee to increase their size to account for the increased number of events we run and to adjust this throughout the year.

Lastly, I’d like to thank you all for letting me serve as the UQCS President this year. It has been an incredibly rewarding experience and I’m glad to have made an impact on the club. As some of you know, I’m graduating this semester, so I am not running again. I’m looking forward to seeing what next year’s committee can deliver and wish them the best of luck. Thank you.

2018 was a wonderful year for UQCS. We grew our membership base from 303 to 429, which is a net gain of of 41%. This was directly reflected in improved attendance numbers for most of our event - our weekly Thursday evening talks consistently outperformed attendance numbers from 2017, and we had some particularly highly attended Friday evening talks as well.

Our technical infrastructure continues to improve. Slack is used more than ever, with over 1800 members, proving itself as an effective meeting place for the cohort, and a welcoming point of contact for employers and others outside the traditional UQCS community. We've overhauled our Slackbot, transforming it into extensibile utility belt that addresses a wide variety of student concerns.

We dramatically improved our industry engagement - we've got more sponsors than ever (12, from 5 in 2017), extremely healthy funding, and built robust relationships with our hackathons, indsutry seminars, and social media policy. Rob's sponsorship portal needs to be highlighted; it provided UQCS a very professional first engagement that almost certainly increased our sponsorship success.

UQCS faces challenges and opportunities. 

- One, if not two events per week proved particularly burdensome on a committee of 7, where a majority of its members were involved in part-time or full-time work. If UQCS wants to meet its goals, an expansion of the commmittee is probably necessary, with committee members assigned dedicated responsibilities, but a lower individual workload.
- When compared to our membership base, women are underrepresented in event attendance. This must be improved.
- This year we focussed on providing events targetting 1st and 2nd year students. We were rewarded with a host of new, active and enthusiastic members, some that had only just started their degree. However, we noticed some churn with students further along their degree. Furthermore, running events that targetted advanced students required a significantly higher time investment, further increasing the burden on the committee. Next years committee will need to find a balance between being a welcoming and friendly society to newcomers, whilst providing engaging content to our more senior membership.
- UQCS is a club well known to students of Software Engineering, Computer Science and IT. We can expand our reach to students who may find value in the society, but aren't SE/CS/IT students (e.g. physics, finance, biosciences). Our Data Science talk that we ran in conjunction with the UQ Statistics Society was a great success; we should continue joint events with external societies.
- UQCS still has the potential to broaden its educational horizons. Lightning talks continue to form the bedrock of this outreach, but UQCS-run, informal, practical like workshops, teaching essential skills ignored by courses, and UQCS-sanctioned student-run mini-courses lasting a few days, complete with tutorials, are avenues that can still be explored.
- UQCS's branding needs to be improved. We reached out to a design firm to guide our rebranding process, but weren't satisfied with their preliminary work, and thus terminated the process. I personally believe that a rebranding could raise UQCS's profile, further improve industry relationships, and grant UQCS a more striking physical and social media presence.

Lastly, I'd like to the thank the members of UQCS for a wonderful 2018. I wish the 2019 committee the best of luck.
